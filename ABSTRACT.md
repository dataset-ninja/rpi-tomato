For **RpiTomato Dataset** 60 tomatoes were selected in the greenhouse (Amorosa, Viana do Castelo, Portugal), each exhibiting various stages of ripeness. Comprehensive RGB images of these tomatoes were captured from diverse angles and perspectives. These images were taken using a [Raspberry Pi Computer Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) camera, featuring a 12.3-megapixel sensor with a diagonal image size of 7.9 millimetres. A 6-millimeter wide-angle CS-mount lens with a 3-megapixel capacity was employed for image capture. In total, 258 images were acquired during this process.
 
This research work is conducted in the context of the [ROBOCARE](https://www.inesctec.pt/en/projects/robocare##intro) project. The primary objective of the project is to explore and develop intelligent precision robotic platforms designed for use in protected crop environments. The project's overarching goal is to reduce the labour-intensive nature of agricultural tasks while simultaneously enhancing the ergonomic aspects of these operations. Such advancements are anticipated to lead to increased labour productivity and economic viability in crop cultivation. It is worth noting that the project team is actively engaged in the development of a specialized robot intended for harvesting tomatoes within greenhouse settings.
