From a different greenhouse located in Amorosa, Viana do Castelo, Portugal, on 15 June 2021, a total of 60 tomatoes with different ripeness stages were selected and RGB images of each fruit were captured from different perspectives. The images were taken with a Raspberry Pi Computer Model B (see https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/, accessed on 15 August 2021) with 4 GB RAM, connected to a Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera (see https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/, accessed on 15 August 2021) (12.3 MP and 7.9 mm diagonal image size) with a 6 mm (wide angle) CS-mount lens with 3 MP (Figure 1b). A total of 258 images were obtained, which made the RpiTomato Dataset.

The current paper is framed within the activities of the (ROBOCARE)[https://www.inesctec.pt/en/projects/robocare##intro] project which aims to research and develop intelligent precision robotic platforms for protected crops to decrease the reduction of labour burden and increase the ergonomics of the agricultural operations and the consequent increase in labour productivity and economic profitability of crops. The team leading the project is working on the development of a greenhouse tomato harvesting robot.
