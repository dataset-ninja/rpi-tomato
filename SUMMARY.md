The dataset consists of 258 images with 252 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*tomato*).

Images in the RpiTomato dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 6 (2% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2021 by the University of Porto, Portugal, Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores, Tecnologia e CiÃªncia (INESC TEC), Portugal, and University of Aveiro, Portugal.
